# LinkedListProject
C program using Linked Lists.
This project was developed using the C language, and I implemented it using linked lists. The main objective was to create a program capable of handling very long numbers from a file and performing mathematical operations on these numbers without encountering overflow issues. To achieve this, I utilized linked lists to store and manipulate the numbers, ensuring that overflow problems were avoided
